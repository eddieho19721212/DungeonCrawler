    Definition of Tiles:
    Most 2D game include map, typically an array of tiles.
    Here, the map structure represents the dungeon layout.
    Each tile has a type describing how that tile is rendered and what happens if we try to enter it.
    We will represent our map as a vector.Each entry in the vector represents on tile,
    so for 80x50 map we will have 4000 tiles.
    Tiles represent portions of the map, and the same tile graphic is re-used to
    represent tiles of a particular type. Entity such as the player or any monster are
    overlaid on top.

    Type of Tile:
    Rust's derive list:
    1 ) Clone -- Add a clone() function to the type.
                 Calling mytile.clone() makes a deep copy of the variable without affecting the original.
                 If we clone a dtruct, everything the struct contains will also be cloned.
                 This is useful when we want to safely work with a clone of some data with no risk
                 of altering the original or when we need to work around the borrow checker.
   2 ) Copy --   Changes the default action when assigning a TileType from one variable to another.
                 Instead of moving the value, it takes a copy.Smaller types are often faster
                 when we copy them around.
   3 ) PartialEq -- Adds code that allows us to compare TileType values with the == operator.
